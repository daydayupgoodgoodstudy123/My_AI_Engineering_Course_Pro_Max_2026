# Capstone 15 — Constitutional Safety Harness + Red-Team Range — interview coding slice

Original practice · 45-minute suggested upper limit · Python 3.10+ · stdlib only.
This is not an Edison Scientific question or official hiring rubric.

## Scenario

You maintain the `15-constitutional-safety-harness` component. Complete its core `moderation` operation,
then implement the independent `evidence_gate` extension if time remains.
The scope is intentionally one implementable slice of the lesson; no full model, training run,
cloud service, filesystem deployment, provider API, or GPU integration is required.

## Core

```python
moderation(signals, block_at)
```

Each signal has category(str), severity exact int 0..3. block_at exact int 0..3. Keep max severity per category, return {'categories':sorted category->max mapping,'blocked':any severity>=block_at}. Empty signals never block. Invalid severity/threshold raises ValueError. No model classifier is called.

## Bonus

```python
evidence_gate(evidence, required)
```

For each sorted unique required name, accept only evidence[name] is exactly True. Return {'ready':bool,'failed':sorted names}. Missing, false, None and truthy non-bool values all fail. Unrequired evidence does not affect readiness. No deployment is performed.

## Shared rules and material

- Edit `starter/main.py` and keep both public signatures intact. Inputs must remain unchanged, including on failure.
- Read `fixtures.json` for six core and two bonus examples, plus `tests/test_exam.py` and `_support.py` for the test harness.
- Floating outputs use absolute/relative tolerance 1e-8. Booleans are distinct from integers.
- You may add meaningful tests in a new `tests/test_candidate.py`; keep supplied fixtures/tests intact.
- Only behavior expressly specified here is scored. Exercise simplifications are not claims about live frameworks or protocols.
- The exact kernel may recur in related lessons; `SCOPE.json` identifies core/bonus names. Repeated content is practice, not an unseen test.

Use your own timer. At minute 45, save, record the current result, and then review.
Keep `solution/`, `INTERVIEWER.md`, the original lesson implementation and external answer assistance closed during an independent attempt.
The local filesystem cannot actually hide answers or enforce a timer.
