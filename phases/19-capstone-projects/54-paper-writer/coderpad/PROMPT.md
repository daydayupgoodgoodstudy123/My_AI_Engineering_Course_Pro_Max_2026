# Paper Writer — interview coding slice

Original practice · 45-minute suggested upper limit · Python 3.10+ · stdlib only.
This is not an Edison Scientific question or official hiring rubric.

## Scenario

You maintain the `54-paper-writer` component. Complete its core `unsupported_claims` operation,
then implement the independent `validate_config` extension if time remains.
The scope is intentionally one implementable slice of the lesson; no full model, training run,
cloud service, filesystem deployment, provider API, or GPU integration is required.

## Core

```python
unsupported_claims(claims, evidence_ids)
```

Claims have unique id(str) and references(list of evidence ids). Return sorted claim ids lacking references or containing any unknown reference. Duplicate claim ids raises ValueError. Having a reference verifies linkage only, not factual truth.

## Bonus

```python
validate_config(config, required, optional)
```

required and optional are field-name lists. Return {'missing':sorted required absent keys,'unknown':sorted config keys outside required+optional,'valid':no findings}. Values are deliberately not type-checked here. Empty config can be valid.

## Shared rules and material

- Edit `starter/main.py` and keep both public signatures intact. Inputs must remain unchanged, including on failure.
- Read `fixtures.json` for six core and two bonus examples, plus `tests/test_exam.py` and `_support.py` for the test harness.
- Floating outputs use absolute/relative tolerance 1e-8. Booleans are distinct from integers.
- You may add meaningful tests in a new `tests/test_candidate.py`; keep supplied fixtures/tests intact.
- Only behavior expressly specified here is scored. Exercise simplifications are not claims about live frameworks or protocols.
- The exact kernel may recur in related lessons; `SCOPE.json` identifies core/bonus names. Repeated content is practice, not an unseen test.

Use your own timer. At minute 45, save, record the current result, and then review.
Keep `solution/`, `INTERVIEWER.md`, the original lesson implementation and external answer assistance closed during an independent attempt.
The local filesystem cannot actually hide answers or enforce a timer.
