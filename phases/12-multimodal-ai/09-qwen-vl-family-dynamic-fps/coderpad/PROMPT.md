# Qwen-VL Family and Dynamic-FPS Video — interview coding slice

Original practice · 45-minute suggested upper limit · Python 3.10+ · stdlib only.
This is not an Edison Scientific question or official hiring rubric.

## Scenario

You maintain the `09-qwen-vl-family-dynamic-fps` component. Complete its core `sample_frames` operation,
then implement the independent `select_context` extension if time remains.
The scope is intentionally one implementable slice of the lesson; no full model, training run,
cloud service, filesystem deployment, provider API, or GPU integration is required.

## Core

```python
sample_frames(length, count)
```

Require exact nonnegative integers length/count and count<=length. Return count indices spanning 0..length-1 using floor(i*(length-1)/(count-1)). count=0 -> []; count=1 -> [0]. Invalid input raises ValueError.

## Bonus

```python
select_context(items, budget)
```

items contain id(str), tokens(exact nonnegative int), score(number). Sort descending score with lexicographic id ties, then greedily accept each item that fits remaining exact nonnegative integer budget; skip oversize items and continue. Return selected ids in that order. Invalid costs/budget raise ValueError.

## Shared rules and material

- Edit `starter/main.py` and keep both public signatures intact. Inputs must remain unchanged, including on failure.
- Read `fixtures.json` for six core and two bonus examples, plus `tests/test_exam.py` and `_support.py` for the test harness.
- Floating outputs use absolute/relative tolerance 1e-8. Booleans are distinct from integers.
- You may add meaningful tests in a new `tests/test_candidate.py`; keep supplied fixtures/tests intact.
- Only behavior expressly specified here is scored. Exercise simplifications are not claims about live frameworks or protocols.
- The exact kernel may recur in related lessons; `SCOPE.json` identifies core/bonus names. Repeated content is practice, not an unseen test.

Use your own timer. At minute 45, save, record the current result, and then review.
Keep `solution/`, `INTERVIEWER.md`, the original lesson implementation and external answer assistance closed during an independent attempt.
The local filesystem cannot actually hide answers or enforce a timer.
